## Introduction

Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.
Generally speaking, credit score cards are based on historical data. Once encountering large economic fluctuations, past models may lose their original predictive power.
The questions asked were:
1. What seem to be the main contributing variables/features to a high (or low) default risk? Are they significant?
2. What about the least contributing ones (if at all)? Do they make sense? Why?
3. Should we reject applicants according to all of these variables? If not, which ones we shouldn't consider and why? 
4. Are there any other variables besides the ones in the dataset that would help to better understand credit default risk?

It's important to not forget that credit card applications tend to have a meaningful impact on peopleâ€™s lives, so there's a need to choose our variables ***carefully***.
